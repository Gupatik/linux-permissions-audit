LINUX FILE PERMISSIONS SECURITY AUDIT
Finding Summary Report
===========================================

AUDIT SCOPE:
- Custom test environment in ~/linux_permissions_audit
- System-wide critical file analysis
- User permission validation

VULNERABILITIES FOUND (Before Hardening):
1. db_config.txt (777) - World-readable database credentials
2. admin_script.sh (666) - World-writable administrative script
3. private_data.txt (644) - Publicly readable sensitive data
4. shared_folder (777) - World-writable directory

SYSTEM FILE ANALYSIS:
- /etc/passwd: 644 (SECURE - correct permissions)
- /etc/shadow: 640 (SECURE - root and shadow group only)
- /etc/sudoers: 440 (SECURE - read-only for root)
- Home directories: 750 (SECURE - owner and group only)

SUID/SGID FILES IDENTIFIED:
- 10+ legitimate system binaries with elevated privileges
- All are standard Ubuntu utilities (su, mount, passwd, etc.)
- No suspicious or unauthorized SUID files detected

HARDENING APPLIED:
- db_config.txt: 777 -> 600 (owner read/write only)
- admin_script.sh: 666 -> 700 (owner full access only)
- private_data.txt: 644 -> 600 (owner read/write only)
- shared_folder: 777 -> 755 (restricted write access)

VERIFICATION TESTING:
- Created test user "attacker"
- Attempted unauthorized access to all hardened files
- Result: All access attempts denied (Permission denied errors)
- Hardening confirmed successful

RISK ASSESSMENT:
- Before: HIGH (unauthorized users could read credentials)
- After: LOW (principle of least privilege applied)
